# idea-Box

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. [Click To Open Repo](https://github.com/KarrarQ/idea-Box)
2. Click the "Fork" button. (This will create a user copy of the repository.)
3. Open the Terminal application.
4. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate to where the local repository will live.
5. In GitHub, click on the green "Code" dropdown.
6. User will see three clone options. Select "SSH".
7. Copy the SSH key.
8. In Terminal, run "git clone [insert copied SSH key here]".
9. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate into the newly created directory.
10. Open the local repository by typing:
    * Atom - atom .
    * VS Code - code .

### Preview of 
App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
It took our team a few days (~4) to write the code for this project. We just completed our fourth week of Mod 1 at Turing School.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project?)
1. Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp.
2. Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model.
3. Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed.
4. Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP.

### Technology Used:
[//]: <> (What tech did you work with?)
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this application was written in VS Code and pushed into GitHub. 

### Future Additions
- The primary future addition planned for the Idea Box website would be for the user to be able to comment on their ideas.
- By favoriting an idea the user is able to in a sense already comment on their idea, but adding the ability to add additional text comments beyond whether they view the idea as a top idea or not would be beneficial.
- It would of course be important that this functionality persists beyond a single browser session just like the ideas themselves do
